            The correlation between mental illness and social media addiction is complex, with each influencing the other. Excessive social media use can contribute to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, while individuals facing mental health challenges may turn to social media for coping. Recognizing this interplay is crucial in the healing process. Understanding the impact of social media on mental health enables individuals to address the root causes of addiction, develop healthier coping mechanisms, and establish a more mindful relationship with online platforms. Integrating mental health awareness into strategies for overcoming social media addiction promotes a holistic approach, fostering overall well-being and resilience in the digital age.
