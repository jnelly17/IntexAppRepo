            The correlation between mental illness and social media addiction is complex, with each influencing the other. Excessive social media use can contribute to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, while individuals facing mental health challenges may turn to social media for coping. Recognizing this interplay is crucial in the healing process. Understanding the impact of social media on mental health enables individuals to address the root causes of addiction, develop healthier coping mechanisms, and establish a more mindful relationship with online platforms. Integrating mental health awareness into strategies for overcoming social media addiction promotes a holistic approach, fostering overall well-being and resilience in the digital age.

            <p1>It takes strength to acknowledge and address these challenges. Everyone deserves to feel safe and confident in seeking help. Just as we prioritize physical health, taking care of our mental well-being is equally important. By reaching out for support, individuals contribute to their own healing and resilience, fostering a community where open conversations about mental health are not only accepted but encouraged. Seeking help is a sign of courage, self-awareness, and a commitment to personal growth, and it is an essential step towards a healthier, more fulfilling life.</p1>

                Cultivating a harmonious balance in various aspects of life, with a particular focus on the mindful use of social media, emerges as a cornerstone in the pursuit of enhanced mental well-being. By consciously managing the time spent on digital platforms, individuals can redirect their energy towards fostering genuine, in-person connections, participating in meaningful activities, and embracing moments of solitude or reflection. This intentional approach not only mitigates the potential adverse effects of excessive social media consumption but also promotes a more holistic and fulfilling lifestyle, where mental health is nurtured through a thoughtful equilibrium between the digital and physical realms.

                    These brief screenings are the quickest way to determine if you or someone you care about should connect with a mental health professional. They are completely anonymous and confidential, and immediately following the brief questionnaire you will see your results, recommendations, and key resources. <br>
                    - Elevated: further evaluation is recommended. Scores for any of the scales that fall in the elevated range typically indicate that you may be experiencing high distress in that area. You would benefit from calling to schedule a Quick Care consultation at CAPS (801-422-3035 (tel:801-422-3035)).
                <br>- Moderate: Scores in the moderate range indicate some potential areas of concern. If these concerns are problematic you may consider further evaluation, or you may consider accessing our online self-help resources, found here (https://caps.byu.edu/evidence-based-online-help).
                <br>- Low: no action is needed at this time. This indicates that this is an area in which you may be functioning normally.</p1>
